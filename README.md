# Pixel Art Maker Project
## Intro
This is my project for the Udacity Front End Scholarship. Here is the project overview:

## Overview
Using the starter code, including HTML and CSS, build the application. The student should write JavaScript code that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

The users should be able to:

* Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
* Choose a color.
* Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
The primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

## Requirements

* Defining variables with const and let
* Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables
